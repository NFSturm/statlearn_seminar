## Introduction

This document contains the code for the seminar "Statistical Learning and Econometrics", with a focus on tree-based models. 

```{r}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(rsample) # Loading required packages
library(MASS)
library(partykit)

set.seed(1997) # Set seed for reproducibility
```

For the regression trees, the Boston housing dataset will be used. 

```{r}
Boston_splits <- initial_split(Boston)
train <- training(Boston_splits)
test <- testing(Boston_splits)
```

Now, we will fit a regression tree.

```{r}
tree_boston <- rpart(medv~., data = train)
tree_plot_prep <- as.party(tree_boston)
summary(tree_boston)
```
