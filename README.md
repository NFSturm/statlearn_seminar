# Statistical Learning Seminar
This implements code of the "Statistical Learning and Econometrics" seminar at Ruprecht-Karls-Universitaet. In the first step, we will be concerned with regression trees, their creation and evaluation. The second step consists in using classification trees. Models include simple decision trees, bagged and boosted models as well as random forests. The datasets used are  "UCI Crime and Communities" and "Employee Attrition". Both were drawn from Kaggle and can be accessed here:

(Note: A leading space was removed. Otherwise R would not have been able to read in the data.)
